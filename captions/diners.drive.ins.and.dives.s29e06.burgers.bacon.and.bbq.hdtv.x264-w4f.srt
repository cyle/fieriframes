00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,006
     It got it.
 Onto the flat top.

267
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,708
       We got our sweet potatoes
                  going in.

268
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,777
And the burger to flip?

269
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,079
               Pimento cheese,
             and it's game time.

270
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,914
             So, here we've got
          our savory butter bun.

271
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,149
 Savory butter bun.

272
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,350
          Our house garlic mayo.

273
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:46,651
  Everything comes
  with a big salad?

274
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,653
                That's right.
     You know, the yin and yang.

275
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,956
    This is a traditional 14-day
                sweet pickle

276
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,457
              that we make here
                  in house.

277
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,793
       Slide the burger on here.

278
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,561
 -House-made garlic vinaigrette.
             -Okay.

279
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,530
              We got our sweet
             potato fries ready.

280
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,065
                 That's it.

281
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,666
 The thing's heavy.

282
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:04,736
Definitely got to hunch
    on this one.

283
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:08,607
Mm. The ground beef has got
 fantastic texture.

284
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,508
   The grind size,
  the griddle temp,

285
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,777
 the caramelization,
  great bun choice.

286
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,647
    The pickle is
 definitely needed.

287
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,015
 That balances out.

288
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:19,484
Got a lot of richness
and delicious pimento cheese.

289
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,720
I didn't know it was going to be
a whole patty of pimento.

290
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,421
You better bring an appetite
    on that one.

291
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:24,589
  SERVER: Pimento cheeseburger.

292
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,157
            It's the best burger
                  in town.

293
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,160
 As soon as I ate it, taste buds
     went through the roof.

294
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,462
        It's like, "Wow!"

295
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,465
So much labor in everything
 you're doing. Why?

296
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,400
        Because we're so focused
               on local foods,

297
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:36,901
               we want to get
             scratch ingredients

298
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,737
 because that's what the farmers
             have to sell to us.

299
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,338
    I love this.
I mean, I applaud this.

300
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,240
    Every day you're in here,
  you're going to see a farmer.

301
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,708
  Coming in, making deliveries.

302
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,810
  -I'm a local organic farmer.
             -Okay.

303
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,312
       A restaurant that sources

304
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,581
           primarily local food,
               that was huge.

305
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,816
       That's part of why
     it's all so delicious.

306
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,151
All right, what are we
going to make next, brother?

307
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,352
            Old-world bratwurst.

      Hang on.
Don't tell me about it.

309

  We're hanging out

We're in Little Rock, Arkansas.
 When we come back,

311
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,459
we're making the bratwurst

Hanging out in Little Rock,
Arkansas, at The Root Cafe,

a full-scratch menu focusing on

  It's delicious comfort food,

325
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:33,858
      but it has a special,
          little twist.

326
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,126
            Old-world bratwurst.

     I like the sauerkraut.
    That's my favorite part.

329
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,165
   FIERI: What are
  we going to make?

330
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,267
                We are casing
          fresh bratwurst today.

331
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,568
So, we have the ground
   pork shoulder.

332
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,603
 We're going to add kosher salt,
                white pepper,

333
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,806
          ground ginger, nutmeg,
                   mix it

334
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,607
             a little bit to get
        the spices incorporated,

335
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,476
                  whisk up
          these farm-fresh eggs,

336
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:54,245
   and we're going to stir those
           into our heavy cream.

337
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:55,714
    Interesting.
    Pull it out.

338
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,449
We're going to go to case.

339
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:59,684
We'll pick the sausages and then
    we'll twist them into links.

340
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,219
      Grill it to get that color
                on the sides,

341
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,587
         and then we're going to
            throw it in the oven

342
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,723
    and give it about 30 minutes
        to finish at a low temp.

343
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,257
  While that works,
   we make kraut.

344
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,426
        This is lacto-fermented,
            homemade sauerkraut.

345
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,728
              So, we'll add in
                our cabbage.

346
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,062
I mean, you're really kind of
     taking this

347
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,397
to a ridiculous level,
 you do understand?

348
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,765
         We got to set ourselves
               apart somehow.

349
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,667
The setting-yourself-apart
 factor has happened

350
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:16,968
  a long time ago.

351
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,803
      Kosher salt, caraway seed.

352
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,472
      Pound and stir, and that's
                going to help

353
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:21,906
     get a little of that liquid
                 to come out

354
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,208
              and make a brine
               with the salt.

355
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,743
  How long is this
all going to get working?

356
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:28,513
      Three to four weeks in the
   summer when it's warmer to...

357

      Hold on!
 I got places to go!

358
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,817
   Can I ask what
the goldfish water is for?

359
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:34,652
   -And where's the goldfish?
      -Where's my goldfish?

    [ Mumbling ]

361
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,022
         Now we'll put our plate

362
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,424
         and we're going to drop
               the brine bag.

363
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,192
        That'll give us the seal
          around the edges here.

364
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,494
              Then we're going
                to cover it.

365
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:43,795
               Around 4 weeks,
               and we'll have

366

        bratwurst ready for you.

367
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,899
Let's go get the other one out
of the back and make this brat.

368
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,768
I don't got 4 weeks.
 I got stuff to do.

      Pot of boiling water here.

  It's heated up in
   the water now.

371
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,605
 We'll just give it
   a little sear.

372
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,240
             And now we're gong
              to dress the bun.

373
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:58,476
             House garlic mayo,
            Dijon on the bottom.

374
00:12:58,478 --> 00:12:59,778
 Throw that on here
    for a minute.

375

Can you see all the fat
  and all the juice

 and all the flavor
that's built inside of that?

377

The key to this is not to break
     this casing

00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:07,919
     and let all
that flavor come out.

         to make your own ramen.

00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,331
     Absolutely.

526
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,599
 Did you guys make ramen at home
            when you were a kid?

527
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,167
     -We made ramen by hand.
            -Really?

528
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:24,702
      Mom made
  hand-cut noodles.

529
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,003
           All right, so give me
                the rundown.

530

           -AP flour.
         -"All-purpose."

531
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,207
Water, liquid smoke.

532
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,876
        -In the noodles?
  -Gives it a little smokiness.

533
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,678
      Potassium
  carbonated water.

534

               Oh, that's what
              I thought it was.

535
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,814
  Gives it a little
    carbonation.

536
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,050
   Pinch of salt,
   add more water.

537
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:40,785
 -To get the right consistency.
            -Correct.

538
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,387
When it comes out, it goes
in the walk-in overnight.

539
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:45,490
           -All right.
-So we're making our pork broth.

540
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,658
       It's not every restaurant
         that you go to in Napa,

541
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,193
         you're going to just go

      -Into the hot water.
     -Roasted chicken bones.

545
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,668
            Low heat, overnight.
         Next day, we add kombu.

546
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,137
      Seaweed.

547
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:03,040
Rice wine vinegar, green onions,
 onions, celery, tomato, garlic.

548
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,076
      -Think that's enough?
        -Carrot. Ginger.

549
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:06,944
                   Tamari.
             Bonito fish flakes.

550
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:09,280
So this is going to cook down
  for how long now?

551
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:10,715
              Hour and a half.

552
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,583
And that's the foundation
 of the ramen broth.

553
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,519
            -Correct.
     -Okay, drop the noodle,

554
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,387
   then we'll put it together.
             -Okay.

555
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:20,024
Pork back fat puree,

 Not something you typically see
