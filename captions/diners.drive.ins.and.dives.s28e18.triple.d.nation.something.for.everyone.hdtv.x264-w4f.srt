                smoked pork,

158
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,271

 flavor throughout the sandwich.

              and Swiss cheese.

162

        of the sandwich.

          it's creamy,

165
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:54,286
 and it goes really, really well
 with the smoked pork shoulder.

166

       It's all homemade.
 It's just a delicious sandwich.

  FIERI: These Cuban meatballs

262
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,706
       are a hearty combo
        of pork and beef

263
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,108
       with a little kick
      of chorizo mixed in.

264
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,212
              NIKI:
  And then we season them with
  cumin, turmeric, and oregano.

265
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:44,115
 FIERI: But I hear it's her new
 homemade Cuban-inspired ketchup

266
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,518
   that takes these meatballs
       to the next level.

267
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,020
  One of the things that I love
       about that ketchup

268
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,522
 is that there's no sugar in it.

269
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:52,424
         FIERI: Instead,
  it's more like a tomato sauce

270
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,126
     that gets a spicy kick
    from the Aleppo peppers.

271
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:58,830
        The albóndigas --
      Did I get that right?

272
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,031
          I think it's
      a terrific flavor --

273
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:03,902
        very chili-like,
        very dusky, rich.

274
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,304
    As a Norwegian, you know,
who's used to Swedish meatballs,

275
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,540
      this has just enough
        little zing to it

276
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,776
     to make it interesting.

277
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,079
                Mm, num, num,
                  num, num.

278
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:17,549
 FIERI: We also got to check out
     Niki's coconut shrimp.

279
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,451
         The best-seller
     is seasoned, battered,

280
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,785
     and dusted with coconut

281
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,521
    before getting pan-fried
       to a golden brown,

282
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:26,257
       with tropical rice
   that packs a citrus punch.

283
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,593
    MAN: If you like coconut,
     and if you like shrimp,

284
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,562
         you cannot find
      a better combination.

285
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,864
     It's really flavorful.
     It's really delicious.

286
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,433
       It's really fresh.

287
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,902
             MAN #2:
   It is bigger. It is busier.

288
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:41,373
 The food is, believe it or not,
    better, so welcome back.

289
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,574
              -Hi.
          -How are you?

290
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:44,109
       Great. How are you?

291
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:46,311
 I was able to hire more people

292
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,846
so that I didn't have to be here

293
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:51,116
     from morning till night
        every single day.

294
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:52,417
           -Let's hug.
        -Thank you. Okay!

295
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:55,553
               We have to hug
        after each one of these.

296
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:57,022
         Now I'm gonna take this
             and get in my car.

297
00:10:57,024 --> 00:11:00,591
     [ Laughs ]

298
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,460
Now, that's what I like to hear.

299
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:05,864
Niki deserves to put her feet up
     every once in a while.

300
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,632
 But coming up, there is no rest

301
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,501
      for these two buddies
          in Portland.

302
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,536
 Now, I thought their sandwiches
           were killer

303
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,004
 when I first checked them out.

304
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,373
If you're gonna have a sandwich,
have a gourmet sandwich.

305
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,741
I don't even know if I want
 to call it gourmet.

306
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,510
-I want to call it funkalicious.
         -That's right.

307
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,712
      But you won't believe
      the crazy concoctions

308
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:21,846
      they're creating now.

309
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,581
    It's killer. It's killer.

310
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:29,654
In 2009, I met a couple of dudes
who just love making sandwiches,

311
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,956
        and they had some
    of the most killer combos

312
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,693
      I think I've ever had
  between two slices of bread.

313
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:37,529
 These days, they're blowing up
        all over Portland

00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,164
 with four different locations,

315
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,900
         and their food
      is still outrageous.

316
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,035
    This is Bunk Sandwiches.
