         I'm Guy Fieri,
      and we're rolling out

3
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:06,638
 looking for America's greatest
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,806
          This trip...

5
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,742
       Is the anticipation
      killing you, or what?

6
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:11,110
      ...whether on a plate
          or a bowl...

7
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:12,144
        Cut.

00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:13,545

9
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:14,413
       ...Cajun or soul...

10
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:16,181
                  Mmm. Mmm!

11
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:20,152
  ...we got a full hour of good
 old-fashioned Southern cookin'.

12
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:21,653
That was unbelievable.

13
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:24,056
          We're talkin'
   North Carolina dumplings...

14
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:25,758
 They're ready to go.
                      Go time.

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,326
  ...South Carolina collards...

16
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:29,528
           And these right here
          are some money greens.

17
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,897
           ...a killer
    Kentucky fried po' boy...

18
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,332
         I'd eat that every day.

19
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:36,035
       And some St. Louis
       Southern comfort.

20
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:37,136
   Just like mom
   couldn't make.

21
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:39,872
         Just like mama
         couldn't make!

22
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,340
   Then we're headin' north...

23
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:42,708
             It's cold out here.

24
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,543
    ...for biscuits and gravy
          in Oregon...

25
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,212
 I could be eatin' a paper towel
   with that gravy on it. Wow.

26
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,647
    ...N'awlins in Indiana...

27
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,816
             Once you cross over
             the threshold here,

28
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:52,351
            you're in Louisiana.

29
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:55,954
   ...and good old gizzards --
 yeah, gizzards -- in Michigan.

30
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:57,656
           This place is a trip.

31
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:59,925
 So, get ready for a down-home,

32
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:02,694
      down-South food-coma
          kind of show.

33
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:04,029
        This is amazing.

34
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,131
     That's all right here,
           right now,

35
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:08,867
      on "Diners, Drive-Ins

38

    You know, on "Triple D,"
        we've hit joints

39
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,680
    that are all about pizza,
       all about burgers.

40
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:24,950
     We've even hit a joint
  that's all about fried carp.

41
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:28,620
And today, ladies and gentlemen,
  we take another culinary leap

42
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:31,890
   to visit a joint that's all
   about the tender, flaky --

43
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:33,992
       Is the anticipation
      killing you, or what?

44
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:38,430
 The tender, flaky, gravy-topped
        Southern delicacy

45
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,632
       known as biscuits.

46
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:43,368
     Welcome to Portland's
     Pine State Biscuits...

47
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,670
Full tray comin' up.

48
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:46,238
     The best biscuit ever.

49
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,773
 About three minutes
    on biscuits.

50
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,408
    This is the perfect bite.

51
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,709
                   Biscuit
            and huckleberry jam.

52
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:52,311
    And a biscuit
 with sausage gravy.

53
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:53,812
  Do you run here?

54
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,180
      Some good home-cooked
          comfort food.

55
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,515
        I got some gravy comin'.

      and Kevin Atchley...

                  Hot tray.
                  We're all
            from North Carolina.

59
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,723
  All of you?
                         Yep.
          How y'all doin'?

60
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:05,958
  ...who ended up in Portland,

61
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,593
          reconnected,
     and opened this place.

62
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:09,261
Why biscuits?
           'Cause we missed 'em.

63
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,996
      People needed a place
       they could stop by

64
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,564
         and get a good,
        hearty breakfast.

65
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,333
        FIERI: Like this
     North Carolina classic.

66
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:15,501
  The best biscuits and gravy.

67
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:16,368
 So get me started.

68
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,903
                  SNYDER: Flour.
All-purpose?

69
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,072
      Unbleached. Baking powder.
                Baking soda.

70
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:23,175
 Why the two?
          That's what gives us
       the best rise, flakiness.

71
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:25,310
            Little bit of salt.
     And we whisk this together.

72
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,146
Put the dry ingredients
   together first.

73
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:28,547
        Then we got the wet mix.
                 Buttermilk.

74
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:29,615
Is that buttermilk light?

75
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:30,916
                Reduced fat.

76
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,720
    We got some full-fat yogurt.
                 Some eggs.

77
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:35,854
                 We'll whisk
             all this together,

78
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:36,989
              and then we shred
                 the butter.

79
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,424
Whoa. We're gonna what?
Oh, this is awesome.

80
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,793
Dude, I have seen biscuits
 all over the world,

81
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,862
and I have never seen
  butter shredding.

82
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:45,397
          It's rock-hard frozen.
 Exactly.

83
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,633
It's gonna create flaked
  deliciousness.
                     You got it.

84
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,701
   Check that out.
    That's nuts.
                        Yeah.

85
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:50,869
Actually, it's butter.

86
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,671
So now we got to act fast
because we don't want

87
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,406
that butter to melt,
       right?
                   That's right.

88
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:55,574
                So we get it
                incorporated.

89
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:57,176
So it doesn't separate?
                   That's right.

90
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,411
     All you do
 is add that liquid

91
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:01,580
and give it, like, two or three
spins and that's it?

92
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:03,615
           That's all she wrote.
  Flour the board.

93
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:04,616
             We're bringin' out
                 the dough.

94
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:05,717
      You just
   incorporated it

95
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,085
  enough to get it
  out of the bowl,

96
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:08,787
  but you still got
some work to do, correct?

97
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,055
                  Exactly.
            They are hand-built.

98
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:12,558
            We're ready to roll.

99
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,127
        So we'll roll this out,
      and we'll do some foldin'.

100
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,663
Not only do you have the flour
creating all of this layer,

101
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:20,199
you're creating layer as you
fold along top of each other.

102
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,200
                  Exactly.

103
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:22,968
          So we're ready to cut.

104
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,536
  Exact right size.
  Goes in the oven.

105
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,004
               Just below 400.
              12 to 15 minutes.

106
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,306
       Hit it
with a little butter.

107
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:29,107
             About 2, 3 minutes
         before we pull 'em out.

108
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,577
I'm gonna try to pick out
the one I think is the best.

109
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,578
    That one.
                         Oh.

110
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,946
Well, now you've done
      broke it.

111
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:35,514
            Well, let's cover it
                 with gravy.

112
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:38,417
       Olive oil. Pureed onions.
            Ground pork. Water.

113
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,619
               Give that a stir.
And some flour.

114
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:41,920
             Sausage spice mix.

115
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:47,292
Cayenne, salt, pepper, nutmeg,
coriander, thyme, and sage.

116
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,894
Heavy cream, whole milk.

117
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,429
    Make a butter
   and flour roux.

118
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:51,830
    Add the roux.
    Maple syrup.

119
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,899
             FIERI: [ Whistles ]
                Look at that.

120
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,601
Little chives.
               Little paprika
               for some color.

121
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:56,702
I dig it. Okay.

122
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,874
Mmm. That is some of the best
texture in a biscuit

123
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,076
   I've ever had.

124
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,744
It has the flakiness,
   and it's light,

125
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,246
  but there's real
  substance to it.

126
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:09,281
  But, then again,
I could be eatin' a paper towel

127
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:10,582
with that gravy on it.
        Wow.

128
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,417
    Mmm! Killer.

129
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,620
    I'd say these are some of
the best biscuits I've ever had.

130
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,955
     Flaky and delicious.
              Biscuits comin'.

131
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,523
             WOMAN:
 It's a biscuit that can handle

132
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,092
    whatever you want to put
        in this biscuit.

133
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,194
   FIERI: Yeah, "whatever" --
       like stewed apples.

134
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:24,129
          You got to have a side
            of huckleberry jam,

135
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,297
         kind of an Oregon deal.

136
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:26,832
        Shiitake mushroom gravy.

137
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,133
                My favorite's
    The Double Down Moneyball --

138
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,335
      WOMAN: Two biscuits,
    gravy all over the place,

139
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,670
     and then an egg on top.

140
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:32,604
       Biscuits goin' in.

141
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,039
                    MAN:
           It's a biscuit place,

142
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,907
           but the fried chicken
           is the best in town.

143
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,743
             FIERI:
So you know where this is goin'.

144
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:39,544
      This giant sandwich.

145
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,079
                    The Reggie.
     Right.

146
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,048
 FIERI: You see, Ryan wanted to
      name his son Reggie,

147
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,416
    and his wife said no way.

148
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:47,653
  So he figured, hey, the next
   best thing was a sandwich.

149
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,655
 First things first, we're gonna
       make some fried chicken.

150
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:51,690
                We'll make up
       the marinade or the soak.

151
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,892
     Little more
 of that buttermilk.
                 Little cayenne.

152
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,060
                  And then
            we'll whisk that up.

153
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,695
             Then we'll slice up
                the chicken.
   Whoa.

154
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,297
Thin fried chicken.
           It's biscuit portion.

155
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,232
         Soak this for 24 hours.
    Okay.

156
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:02,334
             Make up the dredge.
      So, more
of that biscuit flour?

157
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,403
              This is actually
                self-rising.
Coarse ground pepper.

158
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:05,771
         So we'll whisk this up.

159
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:07,606
       Then we got the egg wash.

160
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,907
 A little hot sauce.
                          Yep.

161
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,475
        Wow.
Dare you to lick it.

162
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,843
                 No, thanks.

163
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,279
           So, then we'll season
                the chicken.
  More seasoning.

164
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,448
      Garlic salt, salt, pepper,
           and Cajun seasoning.

165
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,116
   Whoa.
                We'll dip it.

166
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,384
 And then the flour
   on top of that.

167
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,019
 You have a tendency
with some of those spices,

168
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,921
they can burn, so the closer
they are down to the bird,

169
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,189
 better off you are.
                 You got it.

170
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,324
     Dude knows
  what's goin' on.

171
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,059
            And we'll fry it up.

172
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:29,728
     Look at these. That is some
     good-lookin' fried chicken.

173
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,564
     You just showed your North
     Carolina passport just now.

174
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,199
                   SNYDER:
              We get a biscuit.

175
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,601
           Fried chicken, bacon,
            gravy, and cheddar.

176
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,570
How do you get around
   on that one?
                   Don't be shy.

177
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,305
I ain't that kind of guy.

178
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,941
You know the hunch?
                    Yeah.
              I know the hunch.

179
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,811
        Mmm.

180
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:47,846
     Oh, you do.

181
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,348
 That's ridiculous.

182
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,083
Everybody comes together.

183
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:52,217
                That's right.

184
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,052
                 I love it.
      It's got everything on it.

185
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:56,922
I had my Reggie and then
most of my wife's Reggie.

186
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:58,390
          [ Laughter ]

187
00:05:58,392 --> 00:05:59,624
            This place is great.

188
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:00,926
            It's not just bacon
       and eggs and hash browns.

189
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,127
               It's something
               really unique.

190
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:03,195
Two more goin' down.

191
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,963
      Simple and delicious.

192
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,132
Best biscuits in Portland
     I've found.

193
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:08,767
    I'll come back, for sure.

194
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:11,069
Guys, congratulations.
       Oh, appreciate it.

195
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,372
  Dynamite place.
  Killer biscuits.

196
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:15,874
         FIERI: Up next,
    it's St. Louis, Missouri.

197
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:16,775
                   Oho-ho!

198
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,677
            Big-time,
    home-cooked favorites...

199
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,011
    What is this,
  about 30 pounds?

200
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,880
...that are doin' the body good.

201
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,583
       When your heart's in it,
     and when you believe in it,

202
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,685
                 and it's --
     it's more than just food...

203
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,720
  That's soul food.
            Then it's soul food.

204
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:35,160
When you think of Southern food,
           you know --

205
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:37,596
 fried chicken, mac and cheese,
        collard greens --

206
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:38,997
   the question comes to mind,

207
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,933
     when does Southern food
      turn in to soul food?

208
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,503
     Here at a place called
   Sweetie Pie's in St. Louis,

209
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:46,438
         people tell me
      it's all in the heart

210
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,006
 of the folks who are makin' it.

211
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,708
           There's a lot of love
               goin' into it.

212
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,942
               Hey, sweetie,
               how you doin'?

213
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:53,712
    You got to put some love
      in there, seriously.

214
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:54,980
    Is everything
     all right?

215
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,348
                This chicken
             is made with love.

216
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,016
                Is everything
            all right over here?

217
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,952
FIERI: And the woman dishin' out
 the love is Robbie Montgomery.

218
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:04,489
  She's been servin' soul food
     to St. Louis since '97.

219
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,559
       The chicken and the fish,
       the ribs, the pork chops,

220
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:10,595
        the macaroni and cheese,
        I mean, it's everything.

221
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,564
   What's your favorite thing
          to get here?

222
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:15,000
              This, right here.

223
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:18,036
    Definitely, the macaroni
   and cheese is my favorite.

224
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,939
   It's probably the best mac
   and cheese I've ever had.

225
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,774
You want greens, too?
            Dressing and greens.

226
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,910
       Good texture, crisp.
               Sweet potatoes.

227
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:27,279
     Can I have
 the baked chicken?
               Chicken. Chicken.

228
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,280
   It's so tender.

229
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,981
See how it's fallin'
    off the bone?

230
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,684
     The, uh, fried chicken
 reminds me of my grandmother's,

231
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:35,086
   and the cornbread, the way
      she used to make it.

232
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,722
                It's so good,
      you don't need any butter.

233
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,724
                Nobody cooks
     like Sweetie Pie -- nobody.

234
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:40,792
Nobody?
                      Nobody.

235
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,994
 So I got to go see
about my pork steaks.

236
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,529
     FIERI: And get this...
It's ready.

237
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,198
   ...Robbie didn't start out
           as a chef.

238
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,099
            Okay, Bobby, I need
        my turkey wings back in.

239
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,001
  She started out as a singer.

240
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,236
        Met Ike and Tina Turner.

241
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:52,504
 How crazy is that?

242
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,606
 And from there, went from that.
               That was crazy.

243
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,408
And you used to cook
    on the road.

244
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,710
            Yeah, because things
              were segregated,

245
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:02,047
 and we weren't allowed in a lot
     of the better restaurants.

246
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:04,816
                 But we had
             electric skillets,

247
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,518
              and we would cook
                in our room.

248
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,919
   So, we got one, two, three.

249
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,788
      You got your next pan
        of chicken ready?

250
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,623
             FIERI:
   And after almost 40 years,

251
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,925
       she left one stage
    and jumped up on another.

252
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,093
        Peach cobbler up.

253
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,062
            I put down the mike
            and picked up a pot.

254
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,396
         All of these recipes...

255
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:19,831
    Are my mom's.

256
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,166
               Are your mom's...
    My mom's.

257
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,701
           With your Robbie spin
                    on it

258
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:25,537
   'cause I got to believe that
   there's always a Robbie spin.

259
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,605
    It is. It is.

260
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,807
Durin' my travels,
I picked up little things.

261
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,509
                      Little...
  Add 'em. Yeah.

262
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,545
Little tit-tats and stuff
and add it to my recipe.

263
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:36,014
             FIERI:
  Like her macaroni and cheese.

264
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,517
           I've been makin' this
               about 40 years.

265
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,018
      Right out
  of eighth grade.

266
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,620
            Out of eighth grade,
                  exactly.

267
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,588
         Well, we're gonna start
               with the pasta.

268
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,691
 Now, we're gonna add two pounds
            of Velveeta cheese.

269
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,026
           Nothin' but Velveeta.
     Noth --

270
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,528
               No imitation.
Don't give me any...

271
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,729

               no place else.

272
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,731
Don't give me imitation
  imitation cheese.

273
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:53,732
              That's right. No.

274
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,734
               So then we got
               a pound of...

00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:56,835
   Cheddar.
                    ...cheddar.

276
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:59,337
            Colby and jack,
        we got a pound of that.

277
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,772
         Then next, we gonna add

278
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:03,208
         two heapin' tablespoons
               of sour cream.

279
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,077
Just, sunshine, so you know,
that's not a tablespoon.

280
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,712
        Well, I -- You're right.

281
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,980
 That's your spoon.

282
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,649
           That's my tablespoon.

283
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:12,450
      Then we've got butter
         and margarine,

284
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:13,618
   salt, pepper, and sugar...

       Five eggs. You can crack,
               and I'll whisk.

00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:17,856
       ...a mess of milk.

287
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,591
  How much of that?

288
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,326
             No idea. Just some.
   Just some?

289
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,628
             We're gonna top it
            with the fancy mild.

290
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,297
    What is this,
  about 30 pounds?

291
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,165
               Feels like it.
   I tell you, it's a heavy pan.

                That's ready.

Look at the crispy crunch
   on top of that!

                    Mmm.

             The pasta is real.

297
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,880
                 The mixture
          of the cheeses inside.

That does me proud to see you
eatin' it more than once.

we gonna smother it.

         This is Dish.
    Meatloaf up.

385
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,368
       It's comfort food.
  It's like going to Grandma's.

386
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,970
          Chicken and dumplings.
       They're fantastic.

       with a deviled egg

389
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:56,274
    and the biscuit, as well.

390
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,877
  It's just great, home-cooked,
      Southern-style food.

   In a joint run by a couple
  of former nightclub owners...

               Hey, sweeties.

393
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,948
     Originally,
   it was my idea.

00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,550
         ...Penny Craver
      and Maggie Stubbs...

395

             Let's head on back.

396
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,287
    ...who decided it was time
    to serve up more than beer.

397
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,890
We all grew up eating good,
Southern home cooking.

403
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,599
              Most popular item
                on the menu?

404
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,101
Chicken and dumplings.

405
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,270
             WOMAN:
     That's all I ever get.
FIERI: Seriously?

406
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:26,704
     I don't think I've ever
      gotten anything else.

407
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,873
        Southern classic,
 and they do it very well here.

408
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,608
    It reminds me
of when I was a kid.

409
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,210
The dish I would always
   look forward to

410
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,312
that my dad would make
would be chicken and dumplings.

411
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,814
    Tell me about
chicken and dumplings.

412
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,615
                FLOYD: Okay.
      Start off with a raw bird.

413
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,350
      Baste it with a little bit
                 of butter,

414
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,485
       some salt and pepper mix,

415
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,753
                 and put it
            right into the oven.

416
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,454
  And 350 degrees?

417
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:44,856
                350 degrees.

418
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:45,990
                    55 minutes.
   55 minutes.

419
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,692
      Roast it
to give the roasting flavor

420
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:50,295
to get some of that flavor
out of the bones, into the meat.

421
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:50,728
    So the bird's
  cooled down now.

422
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,964
   for the stock,
to get some of that flavor
out of the bones, into the meat.

423
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,533
 and now, it's time
   to "shredify"?

424
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,168
                  Shredify.

425
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,570
  Do you ever growl
   when you do it?

426
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:00,238
             Depends on the day.
   Yeah.

427
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,674
      After we separate all the
  chicken, we'll put that aside.

428
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,375
  Then, we're gonna
start making the stock.

429
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,744
Add the bone and the skin, which
we pulled from the chicken.

430
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,046
 About two pitchers
      of water.

431
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,848
  And the broth.
              Some of the fat?

432
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,382
      Oh, yeah.
   The good stuff.

433
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,351
Some diced white onion.

  a lot of pepper.
                       Generous.

435
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,255
Some celery salt because
that's always really good

436
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:18,723
       to pull
the chicken flavor out.

437
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:22,193
 Granulated garlic,
and granulated onion, as well.

438
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,294
                  How long
           is it gonna boil for?

439
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:24,896
     It'll boil
about 10, 15 minutes.

440
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:27,532
        Cool it just a tiny bit
  so it's manageable. Strain it.

441
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,133
   Strain it out,
 back into the pot.

442
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:31,202
            Now we're gonna get
      into making the dumplings.

443
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,071
               The dumplings.
                 All righty.

444
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:34,439
              Start with flour.

445
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:37,842
      Four eggs and a half pound
              of melted butter.

446
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,011
Mix it up.
                    Okay.
            We're gonna form it.

447
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,779
              All right. Flour.

448
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,948
           And just roll it out
           about a quarter-inch.

449
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,216
             You don't want them
                  too thin

450
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,651
              because they tend
               to disintegrate

451
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,219
              when you get them
             into the hot water.

452
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,121
And we don't want that.
You want them to puff up.

453
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,055
                      Puff up.
       Right.

454

They're ready to go.
                  Go time!

463
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,206
Add our already pulled
      chicken.

464
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,441
           We got white and dark
                  in there?
  Oh, yeah.

465
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,809
   I'm gonna add
   our dumplings.

466
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,544
          You don't want to dump
               all at one time

467
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:16,080
 because they tighten up as soon
    as they hit that hot water,

468
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,749
              and then you got
             yourself this ball.

Big mass of dumpling.
We're keeping them separated.

470
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,819
We're gonna add a basic roux,
just butter and flour.

471
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,187
           But you're also gonna
             get some thickener

473
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,724
                And let it go
            for about 30 minutes

474
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,459
        to cook those dumplings?
Absolutely.

you roasted the chicken,

485
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,013

real chicken flavor.

           soak those in water.

517
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,900
      Put all of our ingredients
                  together.

518
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:46,070
     Parsley, pulverized onions
    because you want that juice.

519
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,138
You want it to break down

520
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,439
 because you're not
precooking the onions,

521
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,408
so you don't want big chunk
of onion in there.
                        Exactly.

522
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,010
             Five whisked eggs.

523
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,511
            And have a binder --
                  mustard.

524
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,979
    That's a lot
   of whole grain.

525
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:57,215
     You'd be surprised, though.
           It's not that sharp.

526
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:58,783
                Mayo. Celery.

527
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:02,053
          Squeezed lemon juice,
          lemon zest, dill weed.

528
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,654
That's a lot of dill.

529
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:06,290
 But dill and salmon
  go hand in hand.
                        They do.

530
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,458
           Worcestershire sauce.
Okay.

531
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,762
So mix it all up,
with the dill, the whole grain.

532
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:13,097
      See, it seemed like a lot,
        but when you mix it up,

533
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,599
          it's evenly dispersed.
   It is.

534
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,334
           This is just regular
         white-bread bread crumb

535
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:17,735
              with a little bit
              of butter on it.

536
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,570
     And we like to let this sit
            for a little while.

537
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,806
Let some of those bread crumbs
absorb some of the moisture,

538
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,207
   kind of tighten
this whole thing up.

539
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,308
Then we'll form the patty.

540
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,676
                   Roll it
  in some Japanese bread crumbs.

541
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,712
Oh, so panko.
           Over to the flat top.

542
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,480
 Oh, and they go
  pretty thick.
                     Oh, yeah.

543
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,849
       And now I push them down.
  A little squish.

544
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,117
         Four minutes each side?

545
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,319
FLOYD: Four minutes each side,
   exactly right.

546
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,687
              We're gonna make
            honey orange butter,

547
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,022
                 which comes
        with the salmon patties.

             Presoftened butter.

00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:41,159
And then goes the...
                        Honey.

550
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:42,994
               Then we'll add
              a half an orange.

551
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:44,228
                  There you go.
        Okay.

00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,730

           deep-fry it, as well.

Without deep-frying it.

of adding the butter

00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:44,008
              I could chug that.
  [ Laughs ]

642
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,077
               I've had greens
           all over the country,

643
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,412
           and these right here
          are some money greens.

644
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,880
               Those are worth
               coming to try.

645
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:51,949
     If you don't think you like
        greens, come eat these.

646
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,551
             Then, if you don't
                 like these,

647
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:56,220
          well, then, you were
          just never blessed
          enough to like greens.

648
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,155
                 And I need
             a side of collards.

649
00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:59,924
     She seasons them well.
        It's really good.

650
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:03,394
   With the ham hock, it just
   melts the flavors together.

651
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,029
             They introduced me
             to collards here,

652
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,397
              and now I have to
                 have them.

653
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:08,065
 Got your pork chop
    on this one.

654
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:11,135
I like how they have
the same menu on certain days.

655
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,571
So everybody kind of has their
day that they like to come for.

656
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:15,473
                   WOMAN:
      I just wait for Wednesdays

657
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,842
          because on Wednesdays,
              it's chicken day.

658
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:19,243
               It's wonderful.

659
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:20,578
             I want that piece.

660
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,746
  Want that piece?

661
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,081
             Look at that. Mmm.

662
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,283
               What's the most
                popular day?

663
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,718
Friday. Shrimp and grits
  with tasso gravy.

664
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,655
 I've tried it in other places,
      and she has the best.

665
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:32,223
 Okay, so how do we
   start her off?

666
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:33,624
                 Let's make
              the tasso gravy.

667
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,027
  First thing we're gonna put in
     is butter, then the leeks.

668
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,262
        So we'll let these just
        sweat down a little bit.

669
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,433
            You're going to add
          oregano, black pepper,

670
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,101
     some Florida Bay seasoning,

671
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:47,004
          paprika, chili powder,
            some garlic powder.

672
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:49,073
Seasoned salt.
               Seasoned salt.
                You're good.

673
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:51,642
                       Basil.
And a little bit
  of thyme.

674
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,978
              And a little bit
              of French thyme.

675
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,746
         Oh.
 You know, I'm so...

676
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:59,750
      And a little tomato juice,
         a little sizzle there.

677
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,652
                 Clam juice.
    Okay.

678
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,920
            Next, half and half.

679
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,255
Now you're going to get
   the roux in it?

680
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:06,290
        And then we just have it
           come back to a boil.

681
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:09,527
Right now, there's
a mini Niagara Falls
going on in my mouth.

682
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:10,728
You should smell this.

683
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,063
          And this is tasso ham.

684
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:14,832
Oh, you said "try some ham."
   Mmm, delicious.

685
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,034
            And we're gonna cut
   the heat off, and it's ready.

686
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,269
Now we're gonna make grits?

687
00:22:18,271 --> 00:22:20,237
                I love grits.
               Good. I do too.

688
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:21,906
                   Local,
             stone-ground grits.

689
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:23,040
       Local.

690
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:25,142
So let's get into it.
             I put the water in.

691
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:27,445
       Next, we'll add the milk,
             a stick of butter,

692
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:28,479
             just a little salt.

693
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:29,914
                We'll let it
               come to a boil.

694
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,082
       Then we'll add the grits.

695
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:33,150
Just good old grit making.

696
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:34,318
I'm the grit danada.

697
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,253
Got to try my grits,
you're gonna love them.

698
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:37,488
      I promise
   you'll be back.

699
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,889
Is that the consistency
      you want?
                       Yes.

700
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,558
Now what?
              We're gonna make
                 the shrimp.

701
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,592
      I'm gonna put some butter.

702
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:43,060
I love somebody
who cooks with a hot pan.

703
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:44,195
   Get her going.

704
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,396
        Yeah, that's really hot.
  How many shrimp?

705
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:46,731
                    All of them.
So just cook those up

706
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:48,566
till they get a little bit
     of a...
                  A little pink.

707
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:51,268
       And then we're gonna put
       some tasso gravy on them.

708
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,237
               We're not using
               all this tasso.

709
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:56,707
We're not because we're putting
it in the back of a '67 Camaro

710
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,676
  that's going back
   to California.

711
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:02,113
Okay, want me to put
some grits on here?
                         Sure.

712
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:03,647
 So the tasso sauce
      is ready.

713
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,449
   Now, can I have
 some of the, uh...

714
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:07,017
              Those are called
                 field peas.

715
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,121
And, uh, green beans?
Okay, let's try this.

716
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,891
                    Mmm.
            This has everything.

717
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:17,962
     Some seafood, little veggie
     in there, little bit spicy.

718
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:20,431
               Mmm, grits are
              perfectly cooked.

719
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:22,266
          Real texture to them,
    but real creaminess to them.

720
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:25,736
  The tasso and shrimp, this is
the dictionary definition of it.

721
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,105
    You can find that dictionary
     at the Flavortown library.

722
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:29,607
              Great, delicious,
                 fantastic.

723
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:31,375
                 All right,
       I got a shrimp and grits.

724
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:32,643
      Grits are wonderful.

725
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:35,279
       Smooth and creamy,
  and they're the yellow grits,

726
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:36,947
          which I love.

727
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:38,215
     I love the tasso gravy.

728
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:40,684
It really brings out the flavor
   in the shrimp.

729
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:42,720
    I look forward to Fridays
    to come to Miss Shirley's

730
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,021
             and get
     some shrimp and grits.

731
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,122
    I love The Farmer's Shed.

732
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:47,158
        I got Jefferson chicken.
These things are hot.

733
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,460
   It beats any other Southern
      cooking around here.

734
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:51,829
This is like Sunday dinner
 at Granny's house.

735
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:54,265
     FIERI: And around here,
     that means cornbread...

736
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:57,134
I love it.
       ...a Farmer's Shed
         family recipe.

737
00:23:57,136 --> 00:24:01,505
Well, we're gonna use
some yellow cornmeal
that is locally grown.

738
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:03,874
                   Uh-huh.

739
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:06,744
         Self-rising cornmeal,
         so some leavening agent
         is already in it.

740
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:07,845
   Yes. And salt.

741
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:09,046
            That's a good start
           we did right there --

742
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:10,114
               didn't come out
                  of a box.

743
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,516
   Add some flour
   and some sugar.

744
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:14,785
                    [ Whistles ]
See, it's gonna be good.

745
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,588
My secret ingredient.
            It's a savory spice.

746
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:21,759
All right, then, we're gonna
put eight eggs in there.

747
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:23,160
             Now, how much milk
               we putting in?

748
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:25,596
    Most of this.
We'll stir it and see.

749
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:26,964
              You're gambling,
                 aren't you?
  Mm-hmm.

750
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,666
    Stir this up.

751
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:31,302
         Is that the creaminess
         that we're looking for?
We're right at it.

752
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:33,437
        And we're gonna put this
              in a hot skillet.

753
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:35,339
           FIERI: That skillet's
               done some time.

754
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:37,541
We're gonna put some...
            Butter-flavored oil.

755
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:38,776
We're gonna fill it up.

756
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:40,978
           Look, that's already
      starting to form up crust.

757
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,780
             That pan is so hot
         right now, you can't --

758
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:44,782
            My hands from here,
    still too hot to be next to.

759
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:47,117
Then we're going to top it
with some brown sugar.

760
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,653
    Now, how long
and what temperature?

761
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,989
425 for about 25 minutes.

762
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,324
             Cornbread is ready?
       Ready.

763
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:55,459
What do you think?
                Look at that.

764
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:56,627
               What are those
                 over there?

765
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:58,596
        What?

766
00:24:58,598 --> 00:25:00,731
            Oh, I guess nothing.
     [ Laughs ]

767
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:02,766
              Look at the steam
          coming off that thing.

768
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:04,134
              All right, let me
            get a piece of this.

769
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:05,736
Like that crunchy stuff.

770
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,471
          Mmm, that tastes great
               just by itself.

771
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:10,374
                 It's moist,
       little bit of salt to it.

772
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:11,642
                      Sweet.
 A little bit sweet.

773
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:13,310
             I get some of that
             butter note from it

774
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:14,612
          from that buttery oil.
                    Mmm.

775
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:15,946
              That is so sweet
                 on the top

776
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:17,615
              that that little
             sugar nugget I got,

777
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,483
             that's almost like
          a doughnut or a scone.

778
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:21,352
   Great cornbread. You can stay
         in South Carolina now.

779
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:23,254
I won't get run out.
           Nope, you'll be fine.

780
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:24,889
       Good old Southern cooking
                right there.

781
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:26,023
 Thank you.
                   Thank you.

782
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,992
        WOMAN: All right,
   and here's your cornbread.

783
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:29,994
 It's almost creamy for a bread.

784
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:32,530
They take the extra time to cook
   it the way it needs to be.

785
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,331
      I feel like I'm part
      of Shirley's family

786
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,233
      when I'm sitting here
        eating her food.

787
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:37,701
                Did you enjoy
                that chicken?

788
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:38,969
       Yes, ma'am.
                         Good.

789
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,304
They just kind of take care
    of everybody.

790
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:41,972
        What is it that you like
              most about this?

791
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,542
Dealing with the people
and serving people food.

792
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:46,243
    How are the shrimp and grits
                   today?

793
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:48,012
    And I'll tell you something.
    I had some great food today.

794
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:49,513
       That's a neat experience.

795
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:53,751
   Farmers' market, garden shed,
         of course, restaurant.

796
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:55,319
                     Good job.
     Thank you.

797
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:57,688
        FIERI: Coming up,
    in Frankfort, Kentucky...

798
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,822
                 I want you
         to take a look at this.

799
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:01,492
        ...a funky joint
  cooking up crazy crawfish...

800
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:03,060
           A notch below insane.

801
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,895
        ...and piling on
     the outrageous oysters.

802
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:05,996
     This place
  is off the chain.
