              Whoa!

135
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:38,403
                 That was scary.

136
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,405
    You almost took that one
      to the teeth, homey.

        Yeah,
 I check the bottom.

139
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:46,178
  It's almost done.
  I need to just...

140
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,346
              That is so fast.

141
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,948
         A little brûlée
             on top.
   Done.

                   I don't care.

145
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,065
      The fresh mozzarella.

146
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:10,969
                  And the dough.
        Look at how thin
            that is.

147
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,672
        My favorite part
       of wood-fired pizza

148
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,742
       is the little char
   that you get on the bottom.

149
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:19,578
       It really just adds
      such depth of flavor.

150
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,747
      That action going on
 with this dough is outstanding.

151
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:22,581
       What do you think?

152
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,982
                 It's light.

153
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,351
I mean, it's just -- You can eat
   a whole pizza and feel great.

00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:27,686
              Yeah.
                           Yeah.

155
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,922
      Life-changing pizza.

156
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:33,759
  Fluffy, but it's still crisp.
  It's got great texture to it.

00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:35,193
           It's great.

        for these dudes,

261
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,337
     and a dining room where
  he used to have service bays.

262
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,405
                MoGridder's.

263
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:43,274
     MoGridder's
was a childhood nickname

264
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,243
my cousin used to call me.

265
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,044
            What is a MoGridder?

266
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:46,945
   We don't know.

267
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:48,079
             How did he come up
                  with it?

268
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,581
   -You could be a MoGridder.
        -I'm a MoGridder.

269
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,615
You could be a MoGridder.

270
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:51,916
   Hey, MoGridder,
  what's happenin'?

271
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:53,151
       Ribs are happenin'.

272
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,021
      In the East Coast, I don't
        hear so much about ribs.

273
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:58,423
                In the South,
      I hear all about St. Louis

274
00:10:58,425 --> 00:10:59,791
               or spare ribs.

275
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,427
     And then on the West Coast,
      it's all about baby backs.

276
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,596
              Why'd you pick up
              on the St. Louis?

277
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:07,632
I think it has a little more
meat than the baby back.

278
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,068
                 You think?
  I think it has tons more meat.

279
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,570
Okay, we rub 'em down
    in a dry rub,

280
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,105
MoGridder's seasoning.

281
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,841
     It's got salt, pepper,
        garlic, paprika,

282
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,711
        and a few things
    he's keeping to himself.

283
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:21,646
  He dry-rubs the brisket, too.

284
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,348
We're gonna use garlic
       first.

285
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,450
Then we're gonna put
 some black pepper.

286
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:27,485
          Do you not notice that
 a windshield just went through?

287
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:28,620
         No.

288
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:31,289
We do about 40 to 50 windshields
     here a day.

289
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,626
  So a windshield coming through
     here in the middle of lunch

290
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,361
                is not really
             that big of a deal.

291
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,263
 It's not a problem.
 You won't taste it.

292
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,398
                 All right.
       So these are rubbed down.

293
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,933
                 Gonna have
                a nice bark.

294
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:44,402
     These'll go on 225 degrees,
               about 10 hours.

295
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:45,704
           -Bada-bing?
             -Yeah.

296
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,539
               Never get tired
               of that smell.

297
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,840
Nope. That's beautiful.

298
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,375
                    Okay.

299
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,242
        Whoa.

300
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:54,412
            Are you there? Fred?
                 Auntie Em?

301
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:57,615
  Here you go, Guy.
There's some brisket.

302
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,684
                Look at that.
                  Oh, boy.

303
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,152
     Always load
  the bottom first.

304
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,221
Otherwise, it'll tip,
and we'll have a mess.

305
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,189
                    Okay.

306
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:05,423
           But we don't want 'em
                  touching

307
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,325
     because we got to let smoke
             go up between 'em.

308
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,027
  And put that one
 on the other side.

309
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,261
     That one on the other side.

310
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,096
                 Pork butts?

311
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,163
 Yeah. Here you go.

312
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,665
              Okay. Pork butt.
                   Fat up?

313
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:14,799
       Fat up.

314
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,735
We've got our brisket on.
We've got our pork on.

315
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,837
We've got our ribs on.
Let's throw some chicken on.

316
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,138
        All in together,

317
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,807
    but each item will smoke
 for a different length of time.

318
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,677
      Now, where are you getting
               your wood from?

319
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,878
              Don't say trees.

320
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,447
      We get it
from the suburbs of Jersey.

321
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,649
      They have
a lot of cherrywood.

322
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:34,285

People say, "Fall off the bone."

                 Nice bark,

           What do we pull next?

We'll pull the brisket off.

Man, that's great-looking bark
      on there.

    Look at that,
 all nice and black.

341
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,093
 That's not burned.
   That's flavor.

342
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,594
    If you cut it
   with the grain,

343
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:17,862
      then it's gonna be stringy

344
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,164

             against the grain.

345
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,231
       Right.

346
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:23,101

353

      pulled pork sandwich,

354
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:38,983

    rubbed with salt, pepper,
  and olive oil before smoking.

               Who's the cook,
                 King Kong?

392
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,561
          ...at a spot
      rocking the retro...

393
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:57,896
That's funkadelic, man.

394
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:01,199
      ...with a menu filled
  with classic diner favorites.

395
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,034
 Get it away from me
or I'm gonna eat it all.

396
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,506
       In a world of 24/7,
    when the sun's coming up,

397
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,541
        well, that means
     the end of a late night

398
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,477
        or the beginning
      of an early morning.

399
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,512
           Either way,
  you're gonna need some grub.

400
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:17,081
      And the folks here at
 The Dining Car in Philadelphia,

401
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,416
   well, they got you covered.

402
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,919
                  Turkey --
             whole wheat, mayo.

403
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:21,953
     Thank you.

404
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:23,054
         -Veil Parmesan?
            -Mm-hmm.

405
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,455
              I often have this
               in the morning.

406
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,758
      Creamed chipped beef.
           It's good.

407
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,960
 -You're gonna like everything.
       -That's delicious.

408
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,762
      Let me show you this
    all-world chicken Caesar.

409
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,730
        -Come on with me.
   -First thing I think of is,

410
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,332
      "What am I gonna get
         at the diner?"

411
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:35,566
   FIERI: That's a tough call

412
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,635
      'cause at this joint,
      they've got it all...

413
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:40,104
    They're always delicious.
    They're always different.

414
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,339
    FIERI: ...at any hour...

415
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:42,807
          -Here you go.
           -Thank you.

416
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,742
 FIERI: ...with local favorites
    like chicken croquette...

417
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,010
   It's very good.

418
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:49,580
   ...and pot roast, Reubens,
     cinnamon French toast,

419
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,316
     even homemade bagels...

420
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:52,850
      We have a night out,

421
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,720
     and we always stop here
         for breakfast.

422
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:56,688
                    Wow.

423
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,723
             You girls roll hard
                 in Philly.

424
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:01,025
Oh, this is what time I normally
     roll in for breakfast.

425
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:02,327
             We had a long night
                 last night.

426
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:03,494
            -Did you?
            -We did.

427
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,264
MAN: If a customer wants to eat,
          day or night,

428
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,166
      he knows he can come
       to The Dining Car.

429
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,802
   Joe Morozin's been running
     restaurants for years.

430
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,070
There you are, ladies.

431
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,572
     He bought the original
       Dining Car in 1961

432
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,107
   and almost 20 years later,

433
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,843
  replaced it with a bigger one
        right next door,

434
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:22,046
   now run by his three kids,
    including daughter Nancy.

435
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:25,483
A lot of the customers came in,
like, 6:00 in the morning

436
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,551
'cause they wanted to be

437
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:27,885
 the last one to eat
  in the old diner

438
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,687
and then the first one to eat
  in the new diner.

439
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,255
                So, have you
              been here before?

440
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:32,924
           Oh, my God.
      We come every Sunday.

441
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:33,725
                Every Sunday?

442
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:34,926
        Yeah.
  We made it today.

443
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:36,427
      -Today's not Sunday.
            -I know.

444
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:37,261
                 Two times.

445
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,129
     Two times.

446
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:38,963
                 Every day?

447
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,498
Every day on weekdays.

448
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,632
              Five days a week?

449
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:42,567
     Five days.

450
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,102
Now, how long have you
     been here?

451
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:45,203
                  32 years.

452
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,572
             FIERI:
 Long enough for Chef Larry Thum

453
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:50,808
   to know exactly what folks
  around here are looking for,

454
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,710
like this classic from the '40s.

455
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:53,711
         -What is that?
         -Chipped beef.

456
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:54,779
      -Is it chipped beef?
              -Yes.

457
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:56,981
My dad talked about it
  when I was a kid,

458
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,816
   about having it
  in the military,

459
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,051
having it in the Navy,

460
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:01,753
but this is gonna be
      a first.

461
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:02,920
What are we gonna do?

462
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,889
                    THUM:
    We're gonna put in some oil,

463
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,725
     and then we're gonna put in
      the flour, in the hot oil.

464
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,093
This is like a hot paste.

465
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,029
   We're gonna pour the hot milk
               into the roux,

466
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,097
    and that usually thickens it
             almost immediately.

467
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,365
     All right.
   So that's done.

468
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,734
 So, what was this?
This was the eye of the round?

469
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,302
              That was actually
                a top round.

470
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,004
        Okay.
So now we thin-slice this.

471
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:21,906
                [ Whistles ]
       That's got a little kick.

472
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,108
THUM: I cut it in squares,
    little cubes.

473
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,510
   Now, remember,
we're gonna frizzle it up.

474
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,311
            You're gonna what it
                   it up?
We're gonna frizzle it.

475
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:29,247
    -Is that a cooking term?
             -Yeah.

476
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,982
           -Frizzling?
         -Frizzled beef.

477
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:33,251
So this is just gonna put
a little crisp on it?

478
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:34,252
                    Yep.

479
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:35,620
           Now, we're frizzlin'.

480
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:36,687
   Chef McFrizzle.

481
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,322
     And people
  order this a lot?

482
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:39,524
          70, 80 gallons a week.

483
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:41,292
You make 20 of those
     in a week?

484
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:44,228
  Sometimes, toward the weekend,
      we'll make a bigger batch.

485
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,597
  You have that smooth blandness
                of the sauce,

486
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,200
      and then you have the meat
         that gives it the kick.

487
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:52,236
       You know, the old standby
          is always white toast.

488
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,939
    Look at that.

489
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,140
         Mm.

490
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:57,775
Oh, the toast makes it.

491
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,977
I used to hear people
complain about that.

492
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,979
          It's gotten a bad rap,
   but not when it's made right.

493
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,114
Not when it's made here.

494
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:06,050
 Get it away from me
or I'm gonna eat it all.

495
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:06,884
                 All right.

496
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:07,985
               Mm. Delicious.

497
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:10,555
          Around here,
     it's still a favorite.

498
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:12,423
   And so's this local flavor.

499
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,724
  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
    What's that?

500
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:14,826
             WOMAN:
        That is scrapple.

501
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:15,993
     Is it meat?

502
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:17,261
                 It's meat.

503
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,832
FIERI: Actually, it's deep-fried
    pork scraps in cornmeal.

504
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:23,634
         The locals love
   to talk you into trying it.

505
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:26,104
      You're gonna be surprised.
                 [ Laughs ]

506
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:31,075
           I was born and raised
                   on it.

507
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:33,311
That's funkadelic, man.

508
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,179
         Today is your birthday?

509
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,314
        Yes.

510
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:39,083
              How about a piece
          of scrapple a la mode?

511
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:40,585
 And it isn't just the scrapple.

512
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:43,621
 At this joint, they're totally
on top of all the local flavors.

513
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,190
It's exactly what I used to have
       when I was little.

514
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,493
       THUM: Chicken croquettes,
    we call 'em in Philadelphia.

515
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:49,627
     Croquettes?

516
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,362
               It's a very old
         traditional diner item.

517
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:52,563
              People years ago,

518
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,866
    they would take their scraps
             from their chicken,

519
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:56,834
           roll it up, bread it,
                and fry it up

520
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,669
           and get an extra meal
                 out of it.

521
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,906
So it's making, like, a little
chicken-and-dough dumpling.

522
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:03,374
       We just use cracker meal.

523
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:06,077
         We use a milk egg wash,
         and we use breadcrumbs.

524
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:08,312
So, now, what do we do?
    Go fry these?

525
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,447
              Gonna fry 'em up.

526
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:12,049
These go down, but they
got to be made in cones.

527
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,585
The traditional diner one
 that's around here

528
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:16,087
is usually made in a cone.

529
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,523
    You place 'em
on a bed of mashed potatoes.

530
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:21,025
            Milk, chicken stock,
                and parsley.
Right.

531
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:22,460
     Hot, I bet.

532
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:25,396
    It looks like
     a volcano.

533
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,365
Bro, that is rich and big.

534
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,833
      The sauce
   brings it home.

535
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,668
  -It's a filling Philly meal.
              -Yes.

536
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,104
         It's, you know,
   one of those comfort foods.

537
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:34,739
               Who's the cook,
                 King Kong?

538
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,707
     FIERI: But comfort food
          at this joint

539
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,176
  is more than just the basics.

540
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,177
       Crepes Florentine.

541
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,078
        It's one of their
        specialties here.

542
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,782
This is one of the first menus
that we've ever come across

543
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,350
that we've seen crepes,

544
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,052
or [french accent] crepes.

545
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:49,820
  [ Normal voice ]
 How do you say it?

546
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:51,489
                   Crepes,
       but we don't make crepes.

547
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,524
 We make crepes in Philadelphia.
                 [ Laughs ]

548
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,593
What do people think?
I mean, you're in a diner.

549
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,028
            It started off slow,

550
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,829
 but then it started to catch on
         a little bit at a time.

551
00:19:58,831 --> 00:19:59,897
Let's get our crepe on.

552
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:03,100
     So six eggs
and six extra yolks.

553
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:04,001
                   Right.

554
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,803
           -Some milk.
        -3 cups of flour.

555
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,038
        Exactly 3 cups of flour.

556
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,706
   Exactly 3 cups.
 See that eagle eye?

557
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,907
             Good eye, good eye.

558
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,109
  So on the crepes,
this is called Supreme Sauce?

559
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,277
               That's correct.

560
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,246
Okay, so chicken stock
going into some blond roux.

561
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:18,649
So that's gonna tighten up
and make, like, a chicken gravy.
                   That's right.

562
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,484
                  Sauté up
      a little bit of mushrooms.

563
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,520
  Now, this is not
traditional diner fare.

564
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:24,889
             One of philosophies
    is that when people come in,

565
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,724
            we have a little bit
               for everybody.

566
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,125
 Cold crepe batter,
      hot pans.

567
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:28,993
              Clarified butter.

568
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:30,294
     Little bit
of clarified butter.

569
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:31,529
              Clarified butter.

570
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:32,863
               I'd rather have
   a little extra butter in 'em,

571
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:35,032
         and you're gonna put in
two ladles full of crepe batter.

572
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,434
With that much butter,

573
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:38,803
 I'm a little gnarly
   about flippin'.

574
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,104
 I mean, I didn't...

575
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:42,506
       You bring it up and over.

576
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:43,641
      Yeah, no.

577
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45,977
                    Okay.
               Want an apron?

578
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,478
             -Ready?
         -Looking good.

579
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,479
                 Wonderful!

580
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,381
           Almost a nice-looking
                omelet there.

581
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:51,215
     [ Laughs ]

582
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:53,584
This is crazy crepe.

583
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,119
  It's crazy crepe!

584
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,721
      Now what?
     Sliced ham.

585
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:59,056
      This ham,
what does this taste like?

586
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:01,225
                Try a piece.
             It's baked, smoked.

587
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:02,660
              -Mm.
      -Virginia baked ham.

588
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,595
    I could have
6 to 12 pounds of that.

589
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,131
   Natural, pure cheddar cheese.
           Fresh-cooked spinach.

590
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:08,933
            And we're just gonna
                roll 'em up.

591
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,801
     This is how
 we roll sushi, too.

592
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,603
    But then we'll just give 'em
         a little bit of that --

593
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,005
You're just teasing me
     with that.

594
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:14,839
                 That's all.

595
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:16,107
         Mm.

596
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,409
 That's really nice.

597
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:22,046
     The kicker
is that Supreme Sauce.

598
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,347
        Mmm.

599
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:26,150
  We try to take crepes and make
        comfort food out of 'em.

600
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,652
       Welcome
  to comfort crepe.

              to comfort crepe.

602
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:31,856
      And the real comfort
      for folks around here

603
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:34,725
  is knowing they can count on
        this joint 24/7.

       and you can always
     count on it being good.

   This diner here
is gonna take care of you.

607
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,533
        And they know me,
      and it makes it nice.

       ...a place so crazy
     about their burgers...

        Whee!

621
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,691

       the combos comin'.

  the beaches with the in-laws.

625
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,470

        we rented a house

626
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:21,839
      here in Narragansett
   about two blocks that way.

627
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,709
   Now, I must have passed by
 this place a half a dozen times

628
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:26,477
      early in the morning,
          and finally,

629
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,012
          I'm gonna do
  what I tell you guys to do --

630
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,081
        That's slow down
     and take a look around.

 Talk to me, Goose.

00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:39,803
             The Luna-Sea begins
                with salmon.

              Check for bones.

              Take the skin off

741
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:45,442
           We're gonna cut it up
       into grinder-size pieces.

742
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:46,911
   You chop it up,
now you're gonna grind it.

743

   mouthfeel at the end product.

       Really?
So, we bring it back,

and then we're gonna mix it
with the pistachio pesto.

regular, ol' hot sauce.

750
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:04,061
                And we've got
       a little salt and pepper,

751
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,096
            which we're going to
             throw in the pesto.

752
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:08,198
     Put a little in the salmon.

753
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,500
            While we're pulsing,

754
00:26:09,502 --> 00:26:11,735
   we're going to loosen this up
        with a little olive oil.

755
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,504
So, we want a little bit
 of texture in that?

756
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:14,705
            We want some crunch.

That could be served on, like,
a grilled flip-flop.

760
00:26:20,313 --> 00:26:22,313
             You have to mix it
              with the salmon.

761
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:24,348
          Throw some breadcrumbs

To bind it.

762
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,083
So now, we have this
    all mixed up.

you portion them up.

00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:31,922
         And when we press down,

768
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,424
                we don't care
     if they're perfectly round.

769
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:34,558
      Okay, now
 we go to the oven.

the walk-in and cool them down.

a couple sheets of phyllo dough.

  And no basting it
  with any butter?

00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:03,454
         and then wrap around it
         nice and tighty-whitey.

785
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:06,423
   Place it on a tray to cook it
            for the second time.

            Cool it off quickly.

788
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,563
  How do we heat it
    for service?

789
00:27:12,565 --> 00:27:13,731
             Put a little butter
               on the griddle.

790
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:15,032
   This side down.

00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:16,300

797
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,210
            That gets the orange

       FIERI:
The flavor profile is huge.

00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:31,048
   The pistachio,
     the crunch,

800

and the texture, and the bite
that gives you -- Great.

      WOMAN: Good texture.

807
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:44,094
  It's crunchy, and it's, like,
     light. It's very good.

   One of the main reasons is
        all the history.

     Here I am, Providence,

 We're gonna put it

   Yes.

              Oh! A whole bunch
            of cheddar and jack.

890
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,544
               Some Parmesan.

              in there, Johnny?

            Or just use a spoon?

903

    use our hand.

 without the chicken
 and the prosciutto.

00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,169
        Now we grab the dough...

put flour everywhere.

    on the highest number first.

 Yes.

 Okay, I just know that we can't

 with some marinara?

   of chicken that are in there.

kind of thing when it's done.

  about a half-hour
    at 250, 300.

  It smells toasty,
     doesn't it?

971
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:29,646
           It does smell toasty.

972
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:30,814
      I'm gonna
   add some fruit.

              and cranberries?

974
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:33,951
 Yeah. Just another
10 minutes in the oven.

975
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:35,886
              Just for granola.
                Smells good.

We're gonna add some cinnamon,
honey, and some maple syrup.

             stir it into this?
    Yes.

we're gonna use corn oil.

    Vanilla, with
a little touch of rum in it.

992
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:05,349
              Vanilla with rum?

993

And now, our dry ingredients,

Flour and cake flour
 and baking powder.

996

 Instead of sifting,
   we're rubbing.

    get ahead of it or anything.

00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:25,168

      the granola right in this?

1004
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,603
Yes, probably slowly.

00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:28,138

   and then you try to whisk it?

00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:38,842
       and you're looking
     for some good Italian.

1043
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:41,645
  Check out this, DiPasquale's,
     making their own pasta,

1044
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:44,481
   doing their own mozzarella,
    casing their own sausage,

1045
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:46,583
     and doing it old-school
    in the back of a market.

1046
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,118
  Is that gonna be
 for here or to go?

1047
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,538
                 Can I have
             a honey-glazed ham?

1048
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,073
  It started wh,
"You make me a sandwich,"

1049
00:34:53,075 --> 00:34:54,107
    There you go.

1050
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:55,675
            Then add more tables
              and more tables.

1051
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:56,943
And that led into this.

1052
00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:58,044
         A full-menu...

1053
00:34:58,046 --> 00:34:59,212
  Do you want that
   heated or cold?

1054
00:34:59,214 --> 00:35:00,514
    ...of home-made Italian.

1055
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:01,681
     I'm having the lasagna.

1056
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:04,084
    The spices, the sauce --
      absolutely delicious.

1057
00:35:04,086 --> 00:35:05,719
 The arancini, I've never had it
        like this before.

1058
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:06,987
        It's always good.

1059
00:35:06,989 --> 00:35:08,355
             FIERI:
     The kind of cooking...
 That's good.

1060
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:10,724
 ...Joe DiPasquale and his wife,
     Sabrina, grew up with.

1061
00:35:10,726 --> 00:35:13,527
            I use what my mother
  and my parents have taught me,

1062
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:16,263
what my husband and I learned,
and put it all together.

1063
00:35:16,265 --> 00:35:17,898
      The food is amazing.
      MAN: Very authentic.

1064
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,332
      More like old-school.

1065
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:20,734
              When I walked in,
             I could smell it --

1066
00:35:20,736 --> 00:35:22,502
       from the fresh mozzarella
               to the sausage.

1067
00:35:22,504 --> 00:35:23,804
     This is all home made.

1068
00:35:23,806 --> 00:35:26,039
 So, you make your pasta noodles
             for every lasagna?

1069
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,007
       Mm-hmm.
                   Oh!

1070
00:35:27,009 --> 00:35:28,041
               Now, why do you
               make the moat?

1071
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,476
    Well, because
I'm gonna scramble the egg.

1072
00:35:29,478 --> 00:35:31,111
           Why not scramble them
               ahead of time?

1073
00:35:31,113 --> 00:35:32,646
I like doing it this way.
                 This is how
       it's supposed to be done?

1074
00:35:32,648 --> 00:35:34,047
                   This is
             what your mom said?
That's right.

1075
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,383
      Pound of flour, five eggs,
               a little salt,

1076
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:37,884
             and a lot of love.
    Yes.

1077
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,452
Then, actually, just
a little drizzle of olive oil.

1078
00:35:39,454 --> 00:35:40,620
          Just about a teaspoon?
  Yeah.

1079
00:35:40,622 --> 00:35:42,255
             You want to get it
                  to where

1080
00:35:42,257 --> 00:35:44,257
  it just stars to form together
           and then grab it out.
That's right.

1081
00:35:44,259 --> 00:35:46,193
        You're gonna let it rest
             for about, what --

1082
00:35:46,195 --> 00:35:47,894
         20 minutes, 30 minutes?
About 20 minutes.

1083
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,696
     You cover yours with, like,
            a little damp towel?

1084
00:35:49,698 --> 00:35:51,231
     Yes, I do.
          So it doesn't dry out.

1085
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:52,532
             This will be enough
            to make our lasagna.

1086
00:35:52,534 --> 00:35:54,100
        Yes.
We're gonna quarter this.

1087
00:35:54,102 --> 00:35:55,535
 We knead them down
    a little bit.

1088
00:35:55,537 --> 00:35:57,604
         Well, then let me play.
Okay. Not too wide.

1089
00:35:57,606 --> 00:35:59,606
            Because it won't fit
               in the machine.
Yeah, that's good.

1090
00:35:59,608 --> 00:36:01,007
     Take it...

1091
00:36:01,009 --> 00:36:02,509
                   Let it
            draw through itself.

1092
00:36:02,511 --> 00:36:04,778
  And it's a nice,
 thick pasta sheet.

1093
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,879
        Now fold it into itself.

1094
00:36:05,881 --> 00:36:06,980
 Back to the press.

1095
00:36:08,784 --> 00:36:10,584
  Change the notch,
    press again.

1096
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:13,019
      Seven times just to get us
               to this stage.

1097
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:14,654
      These'll just get a chance
       to kind of hang out a bit

1098
00:36:14,656 --> 00:36:15,956
           until we're all done,

1099
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:18,291
             and then we'll use
  a little salted, boiled water.

1100
00:36:18,293 --> 00:36:20,794
And a little bit of olive oil.
Give them about 2 minutes.

1101
00:36:20,796 --> 00:36:22,896
I'm just gonna grease the pan
    a little bit

1102
00:36:22,898 --> 00:36:24,931
  with some butter,
a little bit of marinara.

1103
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,166
          Marinara that we made.

1104
00:36:26,168 --> 00:36:27,634
              Look at the color
                on that. Mmm!

1105
00:36:27,636 --> 00:36:29,102
     Go over to
  our pasta sheets.

1106
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,871
                Look at that!
Lay it down in here.

1107
00:36:30,873 --> 00:36:33,440
       Right, and you overlap it
           because that helps it

1108
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:35,075
 stay together when you come out
              with the spatula.

1109
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:37,110
That's right. A little bit
of sauce. Parmigiano first.

1110
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,479
          This adds a little bit
             of saltiness to it.

1111
00:36:39,481 --> 00:36:40,881
      Then I go
for the ground beef.

1112
00:36:40,883 --> 00:36:42,249
              Now fresh ground
                 that we do,

1113
00:36:42,251 --> 00:36:43,717
              a little garlic,
       a little salt and pepper.

1114
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:45,619
Parsley, a little bit
 of the Mozzarella.

1115
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,087
 Nice and melt down.

1116
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:49,155
              And that'll melt
        and spread a little bit.
It will spread out.

1117
00:36:49,157 --> 00:36:51,057
And then we're gonna go
for the Ricotta cheese.

1118
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:52,525
        -Nice and light.
            -Mm-hmm.

1119
00:36:52,527 --> 00:36:53,560
        How many layers of this,
                   three?

1120
00:36:53,562 --> 00:36:54,694
 Three should work.

1121
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:57,230
             So we go back down
        with the noodles, sauce,

1122
00:36:57,232 --> 00:37:00,333
          Parmesan, ground beef,
            Mozzarella, Ricotta,

1123
00:37:00,335 --> 00:37:01,468
         and then again.
           -And again.

1124
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,570
 -We bake open on the top layer.
              -Yes.

1125
00:37:03,572 --> 00:37:05,105
         350
for about 45 minutes.

1126
00:37:05,107 --> 00:37:07,374
                 Fantastic.
             A-ha, look at that.

1127
00:37:07,376 --> 00:37:08,942
              See those layers
                  in there?

1128
00:37:08,944 --> 00:37:10,510
                  Oh. Mmm.

1129
00:37:10,512 --> 00:37:13,113
       That's delicious, exactly
   how it's supposed to be done.

1130
00:37:13,115 --> 00:37:14,381
          Nothing's pouring out.

1131
00:37:14,383 --> 00:37:17,083
         You can taste the meat.
         The Ricotta stands out.

1132
00:37:17,085 --> 00:37:19,252
        That's up there with any
 of the best lasagnas there are.

1133
00:37:19,254 --> 00:37:20,587
           -Great job.
           -Thank you.

1134
00:37:20,589 --> 00:37:23,223
       I can't get enough
of the filling, a lot of flavor.

1135
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:24,925
          This is where
    I get authentic lasagna.

1136
00:37:24,927 --> 00:37:27,127
    I've never had a lasagna
  like this, out of this world.

1137
00:37:27,129 --> 00:37:29,763
All that they serve here is done
    in a traditional setting.

1138
00:37:29,765 --> 00:37:32,299
    You can come here and do
  your grocery shopping, also.

1139
00:37:32,301 --> 00:37:34,601
Not only can they shop,
  they get a bite.

1140
00:37:34,603 --> 00:37:36,636
They get an espresso,
  a glass of wine.

1141
00:37:36,638 --> 00:37:38,104
 They do everything wonderfully.

1142
00:37:38,106 --> 00:37:39,272
    I love their sandwiches.

1143
00:37:39,274 --> 00:37:41,675
      Homemade Italian subs
       are just excellent.

1144
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:43,710
     FIERI: This one stacked
        with Prosciutto,

1145
00:37:43,712 --> 00:37:44,978
   capicola, and soppressata,

1146
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,780
         and they've got
      their own sausage...

1147
00:37:46,782 --> 00:37:48,315
     You can definitely tell
     that this is authentic,

1148
00:37:48,317 --> 00:37:49,449
     sweet Italian sausage.

1149
00:37:49,451 --> 00:37:50,684
             FIERI:
    ...handmade from scratch.

1150
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:53,019
      It really mixes well
   with the fresh Mozzarella.

1151
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,721
 FIERI: Yep, they're doing that
           fresh, too.

1152
00:37:54,723 --> 00:37:56,790
How many pounds of Mozzarella
do you guys make a week?

1153
00:37:56,792 --> 00:37:58,124
                 200 pounds.

1154
00:37:58,126 --> 00:38:00,060
    Because they're using it
    on just about everything

1155
00:38:00,062 --> 00:38:03,163
   from lasagna to sandwiches
     and for the bocconcini,

1156
00:38:03,165 --> 00:38:05,365
        the little ones,
        in caprese salad.

1157
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,000
             It's not a recipe.
              It's a technique.

1158
00:38:07,002 --> 00:38:08,868
              You have to make
 a lot of batches in order to...

1159
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,003
      To really
  get it straight.

1160
00:38:10,005 --> 00:38:11,071
    Starting off
   with the curds.

1161
00:38:11,073 --> 00:38:12,439
           Small batch of curds,
                 submerged.

1162
00:38:12,441 --> 00:38:13,940
 No salt or anything
   in this, right?

1163
00:38:13,942 --> 00:38:14,941
                     No.

1164
00:38:14,943 --> 00:38:16,576
    -It's regular hot water.
              -Yes.

1165
00:38:16,578 --> 00:38:17,577
  You want them all
to kind of soften up

1166
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:19,079
      and start

1167
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:20,347
                    Yeah,
              so I can work it.

1168
00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:21,348
    Look at that.

1169
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,116

          all the lumps are out.

1170
00:38:23,118 --> 00:38:25,285
Okay. Didn't I see this
   in "Gladiator"?

1171
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:27,287
     The sacred
   Mozzarella oar.

1172

We want to eventually get it
     to a ball.

1173
00:38:29,591 --> 00:38:30,991
             FIERI: Kind of like
        I'm working pizza dough.

1174
00:38:30,993 --> 00:38:32,759
              Now we want to go
            into the salt water.

1175
00:38:32,761 --> 00:38:34,894
Yeah, this solution gives it
  its salty outside

1176
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,429
     but a sweetness inside.
             -Right.

1177
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:37,897
                It also helps
      in the preservation of it.

1178
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:39,132
        Yes.

1179
00:38:39,134 --> 00:38:41,067
Cover them, and they sit in here
for about 40 minutes.

1180
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,168
                  And then
                we eat them.

1181

     Mozzarella is so fresh.

1182
00:38:43,438 --> 00:38:45,939

    cheese just keeps coming.

1183

     all the fresh flavors.

1185
00:38:49,378 --> 00:38:50,744

    to taste it.

1186
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:53,013
         Mmm, nice, little salty
   exterior, firm on the inside.

1187
00:38:53,015 --> 00:38:54,581
                    Mmm,
         it melts in your mouth.

1188
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,316
   Definitely a little richer,
         more flavorful.

1189

       a little bit of sea salt.

1219
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,463
        Okay.
A little white pepper.

1220
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,465
             Some white pepper,
           a teaspoon of butter.

1221
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:47,634

  -When it's halfway cooked...

     We throw in
    the saffron.

        -It's beautiful.

can't last that long.

  -Let it bloom and then boom.

1226
00:39:54,009 --> 00:39:55,575
So we let that finish cooking,
and then what's gonna happen?

1227
00:39:55,577 --> 00:39:57,844
              Let it cool down
           for about 20 minutes.

1228
00:39:57,846 --> 00:40:00,246
           Now are we doing this
             traditional style?

00:40:00,248 --> 00:40:01,347
        Yes.

              -Yes.

Grab some rice there.

      -Make a little ball.
            -Little?

1233
00:40:05,554 --> 00:40:07,220
Now we're going to press down

             -Sure.

            -Mm-hmm.

00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,768

               in the center.

1242
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:23,937
Then you're gonna dip it
in your little flour and water.

them with a little bit
of this warm marinara...
