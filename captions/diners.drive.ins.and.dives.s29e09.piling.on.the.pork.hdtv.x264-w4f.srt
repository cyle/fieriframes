00:00:01,202 --> 00:00:02,267
         Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,736
         I'm Guy Fieri,
      and we're rolling out

3
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:06,739
 looking for America's greatest
  diners, drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:08,574
          This trip...
[ Laughing ]

5
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:10,142
 ...we're piling on the pork...

6
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:12,478
  I like me a tender hog foot.
              -Yes.

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,413
 ...and some hearty homecooking.

8
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:15,681
         I'd eat that every day.

9
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:18,717
     Check out these monster
     chops in San Antonio...

10
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,185
     Holy moly!

11
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,788
       ...pig's head tacos
        in New Orleans...

12
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,423
They're gonna flock-o
   for this taco.

13
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:27,526
  ...plus, Southern bird meets
       Far East flavor...

Dude, that's righteous.

17
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,968
     That's all right here,
           right now,

   So, I'm here in New Orleans
        on Broad Street,

22
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:54,753
        just a few blocks
         away from Canal

23
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,922
   that'll take you right down
         to the Quarter.

24
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:58,457
      Listen, I love coming
          to this city.

25
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:02,027
  You got great people, amazing
 food, all kinds of characters,

26
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:03,996
       you got the party,
      you got the history,

27
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:05,631
      and listen, I'm here
      to check out a joint

28
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:07,466
       that's got all that
         under one roof.

29
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:10,736
     This is Marjie's Grill.

30
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,404
              Charred pig tail
               in the window.

31
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,972
     I love this restaurant.

32
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:16,008
              Fresh cracklings
                for you guys.

33
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,509
    Nothing like it in town.

34
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,878
        Southeast Asian Southern
    barbecue is what we call it.

35
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,213
  FIERI: And it's what you get

36
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:23,048
       when Marcus Jacobs
       and Caitlin Carney

37
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,017
  travel through Southeast Asia

38
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:28,120
  and bring new culinary tricks
      to Big Easy cooking.

39
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:30,589
         Louisiana, Mississippi,
          Gulf Coast ingredients

40
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,192
 seasoned with Thai, Vietnamese,
              and Lao flavors.

41
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:35,594
Well, you guys are just
 gigantic copycats.

42
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,162
   This is crazy.

43
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,465
  It's new. I think he invented
   a whole new genre of food.

44
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:41,467
     FIERI: And apparently,
      a whole new language.

45
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:43,135
          Honey butter yardbird.

46
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:44,236
Da whoda wini henay?

47
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:45,370
             -Honey.
             -Honey.

48
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:46,472
            -Butter.
            -Butter.

49
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:48,240
           -Yardbird.
     -Honey butter yardbird.

50
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:50,042
       My favorite chicken
         in New Orleans.

51
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:52,911
   Ah, man. It's the smoke --
     the grill in the back.

52
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:56,181
   It's got this amazing chili
   and herb sauce with garlic.

53
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,483
       You can't beat it.

54
00:01:57,485 --> 00:01:58,951
      This is the chicken spice.
             This is what we use

55
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,352
              to rub our honey
              butter yardbird.

56
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,420
    Let's see it.

57
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:03,188
                First, we go
             salt, black pepper,

58
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,023
           paprika, white pepper
               right there...

59
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:07,126
             -Okay.
-...garlic powder, onion powder.

60
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:09,027
            -Japones?
  -It's like a Japanese chili.

61
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:10,529
                  Add dried
             Vietnamese chilies.

62
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,731
   Oh, I'm sorry.
  Did I miss this?

63
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:13,899
              The slogan, man.

64
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:17,369
     Marjie's --
"A rad place to jam."

65
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:18,871
That's the best line ever.

66
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:21,206
         Now we're gonna butcher
      the chicken -- spatchcock.

67
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,442
But you did it down the breast
and not down the back.

68
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:24,810
                  Correct.
                  This way,

69
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,245
           it gets a lot of that
   smoke flavor in the breast...

70
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:28,247
             -Okay.
   -...from the grill outside.

71
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:29,615
       -This is the setup.
             -Yeah.

72
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:30,983
     So, we're just gonna put it
                right on here

73
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,919
    over our burning oak logs --
          about two hours or so.

74
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:36,288
      Love it.
Only in New Orleans.

75
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,190
      All right, next up...
      -A chili garlic sauce

76
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:40,125
     to serve alongside it.
           -I dig it.

77
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:42,461
           We add some shallots.
       So, these get pounded up.

78
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:45,063
            -Next...
      -The garlic, chilies,

79
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:49,034
       raw Louisiana cane sugar,
     lime juice, and fish sauce.

80
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,570
 All that together.

81
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:54,606
I'll have that on any...
      bath mat.

82
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,975
          So, we got our chicken
  all glazed up here with honey,

83
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,578
           butter, and some more
          of that chicken spice.

84
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,613
Okay. And this is one of
the staples of the house.

85
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,048
                 Definitely.

86
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,483
       This is my favorite thing
         that we ever cook here.

87
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:06,518
                Some of that
             chili garlic sauce.

88
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,287
            And it gets finished
  with a little French sea salt.

into great Southern chicken,
and all of a sudden,

93
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,799
I come into fish sauce
    and chilies.

94
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,401
                    Yeah.
            And, I mean, I think

95
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:24,570
               that it bridges
         the Louisiana influence

96
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:26,438
              and the Southeast
              Asian influence.

97
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,507
I don't know how much
   it bridges it,

98
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:33,045
as much as it creates
its own new superhighway.

99
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:35,981
  This garlic sauce
 should be bottled.

100

This chicken -- you get
the heat, you get the sweet,

101
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:41,587
you get the vinegar, you get
the spice, you get the salt.

102
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,289
You're setting people up to be
disappointed next time

103

  they have to eat
just regular smoked chicken.

       when I was younger,

116
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,913

   -What a cool way to do it.
             -Yeah.

118

 There's fish sauce
on the knuckles and fresh herbs

125
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:26,832
that you wouldn't normally
find with Southern cuisine.

126
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,634
 All right, brother.
Tell me all about it.

        JACOBS: We're gonna take
           these split pig feet,

128
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:30,869
               boil them off,

129
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,037
                 and get rid
           of some of that funk.

130
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,306
      -Get rid of the funk.
         -A little salt.

131
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:36,008
 While that's going, we're gonna
          make ourselves a nice,

132
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,244
  flavorful, crawfish-boil-style
     braise to cook the feet in.

00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,679
We got three gallons of water...
            -Got it.

134
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:42,547
              ...our soy sauce,
                fish sauce...

00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,116
Copious amounts of garlic.

   ...cut lemons, dried chilies,
             Japones, of course.

137
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,387
             -Okay.
       -And some satsumas.

138
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:49,554
     That's what
 I was gonna put in.

139
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,189
                    Yeah.
        That's Louisiana citrus.

140
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,358
       Some onions, and...
         -Crawfish boil.

141
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,993
 -Crawfish boil seasoning, yes.
            -Got it.

142
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,161
           We're gonna simmer it

143
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:57,863

              strain this out,

144
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,865
             and then cook them
            in the flavored boil

145
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,199
                for about two

  -I like me a tender hog foot.
              -Yes.

147
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,836
       Yeah, you don't want them
                  al dente.

148
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,104
And then, we'll drop

Fresh cracked.

151
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,443

152
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:12,577

               of restaurants.

390
00:12:58,345 --> 00:12:59,410
       I've never seen that cut.

391
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:00,578
               I've never seen
             that presentation.

392
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:07,218
My dance team in the hallway
are the best, by the way.

393
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,787
     These guys
   are priceless.

394
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,556
                     ♪♪

395
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:13,825
  So, I'm here in the southeast
   side of San Antonio, Texas,

396
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:16,027
      and I got to tell ya,
  I have talked more people out

397
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,862
 of getting into the restaurant
 business than you can imagine,

398
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,631
  especially if they don't have
      a ton of experience,

399
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:20,665
    but listen to this story.

400
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,233
This girl comes from Puerto Rico

401
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:25,036
 and gets her degree in Medical
     Imaging in New Mexico,

402
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,404
        and then she goes
       and teaches school,

403
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,039
      and all of a sudden,
      on a whim, she says,

404
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,108
       "I'm gonna open up
   a Puerto Rican restaurant."

405
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,943
      You know what I say?
             No way.

406
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,378
          But she did,
      and she's killing it.

407
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,748
       This is Luna Rosa.

408
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,249
              Guavate, table 1.

409
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,884
MAN #4: Every time I bring folks
           over here,

410
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,419
   all I get is rave reviews.

411
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,154
              Two more minutes
            on that seafood mix.

412
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,757
    This is like Puerto Rico
         in South Texas.

413
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,859
       You don't get stuff
    like this anywhere else.

414
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,261
    FIERI: And you don't hear
   stories like Iris Ornelas'

415
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:51,462
       most places either.

416
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:52,597
So, how did the restaurant
       start?

417
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:53,765
You stopped teaching?

418
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,400
               After 25 years,
              I stopped teach--

419
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:57,035
You taught for 25 years?!

420
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,070
     Now I'm doing what I wanted
           to do when I grew up.

421
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,438
   The whole time,
you wanted to be a chef?

422
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,873
                   This is
            what I wanted to do.

423
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,142
    So now she's doing it --
      firing up traditional

424
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:07,745
 Puerto Rican recipes alongside
     her own creative spins.

425
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:09,180
  MAN #5: The Caribbean nachos.

426
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,715
             This is
    my favorite thing to get

427
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,550
      'cause it's not like
      your typical nachos.

428
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:15,119
FIERI: That's right -- no simple
     chips and cheese here.

429
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:19,290
    This is plantains loaded
       with culinary plus.

430
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,492
     The first thing we're gonna
              make is the base

431
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:24,162
  for every Puerto Rican food --
                the sofrito.

432
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:26,497
    The base -- it has recao.
             -Recao.

433
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,900
             Most people call it
                  culantro.

434
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,802
       Very similar to cilantro.

435
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:32,036
                  Some oil.

436
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,038
                  Blend it.
        Put the onions in there.

437
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,107
    -That's a lot of garlic.
            -Garlic.

438
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:37,342
That's the foundation
   of everything.

439
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:38,576
           That's the foundation
               of everything.

440
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,044
     All right.

441
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,145
         Now we're going to make
         the brew for the beans.

442
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,547
           -The what?
      -We call it the brew.

443
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,916
           -I like it.
   -First, add some olive oil.

444
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:46,851
                   Bacon.
              And then, garlic.

445
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,386
      -Some of the sofrito.
            -Sofrito.

446
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,121
                 The onions.
             Green bell peppers.

447
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,389
         Add some salt.
             -Okay.

448
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,191
        Annatto -- or achiote --

449
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:56,761
    powder to give it some color
           and some good flavor.

450
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,096
And then, what is this?

451
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,197
              That is pumpkin.

452
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,531
I've made a lot of beans.

453
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,066
   I've never put
   pumpkin in it.

454
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,903
           Puerto Rican beans --
        most people add pumpkin,

455
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,537
                and it's just
              not any pumpkin.

456
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:07,772
      It's Puerto Rican --
   -It's not just any pumpkin.

457
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,374
           Puerto Rican pumpkin.

458
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:11,309
   Oh, of course,
it's Puerto Rican pumpkin.
           Puerto Rican pumpkin.

459
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:12,543
 That's all I carve
    at Halloween.

460
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:14,045
          Add some tomato sauce.

461
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:17,282
       Top it with water so that
   it can boil for a little bit.

462
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:18,216
              Dry pinto beans.

463
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,384
             -Right.
             -Salt.

464
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,486
          More sofrito.
       -Green bell pepper.

465
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,521
         -And the onion.
   -How long is this gonna go?

466
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:26,291
       -For about an hour.
     -And then what happens?

467
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,927
       We're gonna add that brew
            to our cooked beans.

468
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,562
And that's just the beans,
just as a side dish?

469
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:32,830
          -Just -- yes.
         -A lot of work.

470
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:34,666
              Now we're making
               the pork roast.

471
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:35,767
            We call it pernil --

472
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,535
              very traditional
               in Puerto Rico.

473
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:41,539
           We have salt, garlic,
           pepper, oregano, oil.

474
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,608
          Rub the pork.
              -Wow.

475
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,711
    They're gonna go in the oven
            for about six hours.

476
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:47,812
What's our next step?

477
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:49,814
              A Hatch red chili
               for our nachos.

478
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:50,782
             -Hatch?
         -Hatch -- yes.

479
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:51,950
                 And that's
              not Puerto Rican,

480
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,885
              but my husband is
              from New Mexico,

481
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:56,354
              so I had to have
         something here for him.

482
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:57,522
So, give me the rundown.

483
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,757
                   This is
          the Hatch chili puree.

484
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,060
      Salt, garlic, and oregano.

485
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,594
      And a little bit of water.

486
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:06,331
    And then, it's going to boil
             until it thickens.

487
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,434
And on top of these nachos,
we're gonna use plantains?

488
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:12,103
         -Yes -- fried.
           -I like it.

489
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:14,572
Now we're gonna build them --
the Caribbean nachos.

490
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:15,773
             -Okay.
         -Add the beans.

491
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:16,941
    Chili sauce.

492
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,509
        Pork.
       Cheese.

493
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,211
     In the oven
for about five minutes.

494
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,312
         To let the cheese melt,

495
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,547
           and then bring it out
               and garnish it?

496
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,349
        Yes.
  Luna Rosa sauce.

497
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:25,550
     The recao.

498
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,518
 And there are your
  Caribbean nachos.

499
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,655
              I don't even know
               where to start.

500
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,790
                    Mmm!
       The pork is super tender.

501
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,125
          Plantains are crunchy.

502
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,460
     For anybody that hasn't had
                 a plantain,

503
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:38,663
                this would be
   a great way to experience it.

504
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,098
          Some of the best beans
                  I've had.

505
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,933
   Now, that's a different level
            right there, sister.

506
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:43,835
                Great flavors
             and a big portion.

507
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,703
                  I can see
           why people are happy.

508
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,939
      Definitely the nachos
          is my go-to.

509
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:50,008
The pork is really, really good.

510
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,843
     Oh, the best, the best.

511
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,511
            Ropa Vieja, table 2.

512
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,812
What makes the place
     so special?

513
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,247
     They treat you like family.

514
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:57,548
        Everybody's family here.

515
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,017

  I was just completely amazed.

     Holy moly.

524
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,202
I don't think I've ever seen
  a chop like that.

525
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,639
It looks like a cross
between a Halloween mask

and some meat dreadlocks.

       FIERI: At Luna Rosa
     in San Antonio, Texas,

531
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,987
   former teacher Iris Ornelas
     is schooling the locals

532
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:37,822
          on authentic
      Puerto Rican cooking.

             Cuban with sweets.

534
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,625
           I always kept telling
                 my husband,

535
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,760
    "I want to own a restaurant.
              I want to cook."

536
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,295
 So, you always had
the restaurant in your head.

537
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:45,763
                  Yes, yes.

538
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:48,533
    So, she left her 25-year
teaching career and went for it.

539
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,568
              So, I went home,
         told my husband, and --

540
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,769
"Hey, guess what, honey?

541
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:52,937
    We're in the
restaurant business."

542

543
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,808

     WOMAN #3: This is like

546
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,612
         the Flintstone
  brontosaurus-type pork chop.

547
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:03,681
  MAN #6: Once you mix it with
  the white rice and the beans,

            it's like
    a perfect, perfect plate.

00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:07,718
            We are going to make

     Holy moly.

00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:12,623
I don't think I've ever seen
  a chop like that.

553
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,092
                    Yeah.
            They're very unique.

554
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,493
You've got the pork chop.

555
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,361
  This is the back.
Now you come down the side.

556
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,863
        Here's your ribs.
         -That's a rib.

557
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,098
        Wow.

558
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,599
This thing is just riddled
    with flavor.

559
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:25,103
The only challenge to this
is how to cook this all together

560
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,605
and not have these loins
become dry by the time

561
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,408
     these sides
and rib areas become tender.

562
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,777
               So, that's why
               we brine them.

563
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,213
            Add salt.
    -Just a tiny bit of salt.

564
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,181
              -Yes.
-So, these are brined overnight.

565
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,850
             Next, we are going
               to season them.

566
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,318
              Salt and oregano.

567
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,186
                Garlic salt.
                  Sofrito.

568
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,855
          And then oil.
             -Okay.

569
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:45,523
       And why
 are we making two?

570
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:47,391
       Well, I guess one for you
               and one for me.

571
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:48,759
 Sounds good to me.

572
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,294
      Okay, so now, we are going
             to add the annatto,

573
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,497
                 especially
               around the edge

574
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:56,200
     because we want the annatto
   to make the skin very crispy.

575
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:59,704
The annatto seed is ground up
to make the achiote powder

576
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:03,641
   to give a nice,
beautiful, red hue to this.

577
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,409
     Then, we're gonna bake them
          for 15 minutes at 350.

578
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:06,811
  For 15 minutes --
     that's it?

579
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,514
       Because then, after that,
           we fry them to order.

580
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:10,715
           Let's see it, sister.

pork chop with white rice.

  with some recao.

583
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,088
      The beans
